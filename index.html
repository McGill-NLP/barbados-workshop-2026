            <p>
                Propelled by the success of deep learning, artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to transform science. Science strives to discover theories that predict the outcome of experiments and allow us to control the future. In harmony with these goals, deep learning is driving a revolution in how we build predictive and decision-making models, creating obvious potential to alter and accelerate scientific discovery.
            </p>
            <p>
                Historically, scientific theories have needed to be simple and compact enough to be written down and understood. This is changing as we explore the idea that scientific theories can be embodied in the weights of massive neural networks: our best theory for protein folding now lives in millions of parameters of a transformer network, largely inscrutable to humans. Hot on the heels of proteomics, deep learning is poised to transform many fields of science and mathematics. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The workshop will bring together leaders in deep learning with top scientists and mathematicians in their respective domains to understand advances in the physical sciences and mathematics driven by deep learning, such as protein folding, chemistry, quantum physics, geometry, and theorem proving. We will examine methodologies for embedding physical and mathematical intuitions into neural network architectures and algorithms: What are the best ways to build inductive biases into networks? Finally, we’ll examine the potential of large language models to help us summarize, synthesize and analyze the scientific literature itself.
            </p>

            <h2 id="questions">Questions for Thought</h2>
            <p>
                This workshop is not just about showcasing tools, but about asking what happens to science itself when AI systems
                become central to how we model, predict, and explain the world.
            </p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>
                <strong>Where will scientific paradigms live in the age of AI?</strong><br>
                As knowledge moves from textbooks and equations into simulations and large models, is this a genuine paradigm
                shift or just a new storage medium?
                </li>
            
                <li>
                <strong>What role should human understanding and agency play in AI-driven science?</strong><br>
                If we can use models we don't fully understand, what kinds of understanding do we still demand from scientists
                and trainees?
                </li>
            
                <li>
                <strong>Omni-models or domain specialists?</strong><br>
                Is the future "one model to rule them all" across domains, or a collection of highly
                specialized models, and what are the trade-offs?
                </li>
            
                <li>
                <strong>Is there an emerging playbook for AI-for-Science?</strong><br>
                Are we converging on a standard recipe, accurate but slow simulators, amortized surrogates, differentiable
                pipelines, and how do we know when these surrogates truly generalize?
                </li>
            
                <li>
                <strong>Can AI grapple with open-ended discovery?</strong><br>
                Beyond supervised prediction, to what extent can current or near-future systems generate meaningful hypotheses,
                concepts, and research directions?
                </li>
            
                <li>
                <strong>What tools do we have, and what tools are missing?</strong><br>
                Which existing AI/ML capabilities are already reshaping scientific practice, and what critical tools (for
                uncertainty, causality, interpretability, or interfaces) are still absent?
                </li>
            </ol>
              
            <h2 id="program">Scientific Program</h2>

            <h3>The Most Important House Rules</h3>
            <p>Kitchen and Food</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Breakfast is eaten together Saturday-Friday at Bellairs.</li>
                <li>Lunch may be purchased from a grocery store or nearby restaurants.</li>
                <li>Dinner is eaten together Sunday-Thursday at Bellairs.</li>
                <li>We can make coffee and tea in the kitchen any time we want.</li>
                <li>Please leave the kitchen clean.</li>
                <li>There is a guest fridge in the kitchen where we can keep our own private food. Please label your food and remove any left over when you depart.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Showers and Sand</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Sand in the shower drains can cause enormous blockage problems. Please be sure to rinse off the sand from your feet before entering your rooms. There are water taps outside both blocks of rooms for this purpose.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Locked Doors and Valuables</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Barbados is a rather safe country in general but normal precautions when travelling should be taken for your money and valuables.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Telephone</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Telephones and computers are available in the main office (sort of).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Bellairs Survival Hints</h3>
            <p>Food and Snacks</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We will have a cook and the food is great but if you need anything special please bring it along. There will be a fridge where we can keep our private food items.</li>
                <li>The coffee there is of the instant variety. If you wish to bring your own coffee you may do so.</li>
                <li>
                    Vegetarians may want to bring their favorite non-perishables, however it is not necessary since there is already a diverse selection at the local supermarket. There is also good vegetarian roti in several places near
                    Bellairs.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Beach, Sun, Snorkeling, and SCUBA diving</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bellairs is situated on one of the best beaches in Barbados, so don't forget your bathing suit (and skin protection) for swims before breakfast and in between work sessions.</li>
                <li>
                    There is also good snorkeling right in front of Bellairs so if you have a mask and fins bring them along too. In fact, if you SCUBA dive bring your gear. There is diving right there as well and air tanks at Bellairs cost
                    only about US$12.00 per tank!
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Mosquitos</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Depending on the weather conditions and other factors, we may get some mosquitoes. You should bring some bug repellant just in case.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Flying in</h3>
            <p>Please see the <a href="https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2022">Barbados Official Travel Protocols</a> for the rules that are currently in place on the island.</p>
            <p>
                As of January 10, 2023, that site said "Effective midnight, Thursday September 22, 2022, Barbados will discontinue all COVID-19 related travel protocols. Therefore, there will be no testing requirements for entering Barbados
                whether you are vaccinated or unvaccinated."
